# ARR SAC Tool

This repository contains a jupyter notebook that I was used in [ARR (ACL Rolling Review)](http://aclrollingreview.org) Feb 2025 cycle as an [SAC (Senior Area Chair)](https://2025.aclweb.org/committees/program/), which was an important cycle for [ACL 2025]((https://2025.aclweb.org/).
I think it is useful to document such tool here if someone else wants to use it in the future ARR cycle.
The notebook is completely based on OpenReview API, so it is safe and easy to use.

Some major features of this notebook:
- check all papers & reviews under your SAC batch
- retrieve meta-review & status
- retrieve confidential comments to editors, and review issue reports
- visualizations of review/meta-review scores

Personally, I prefer to use this notebook in Colab, as I may want to manipulate the data in a more interactive way. 
You may also want to check [arr-report-generator](https://github.com/mtreviso/arr-report-generator), which is an interactive HTML reports for reviewing ARR submissions.
